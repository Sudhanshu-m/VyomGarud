## 🎨 Design Decisions

This section covers the design and technical choices made to meet the project brief.

### 1. Brand Aesthetic
I aimed for the required "dark, modern, and slightly military/futuristic" aesthetic. I used a dark charcoal/black base for all sections to create a cohesive, high-tech, and professional feel that makes the content stand out.

### 2. Color Palette
The color palette is based strictly on the requirements:

* **Charcoal (`#131313`)**: Used as the primary background for all sections to ensure a consistent dark mode.
* **White (`#e0e0e0`)**: Used for all primary text to ensure high readability against the dark background.
* **Orange (`#ff7b00`)**: This was the main accent color. I used it strategically for all Call-to-Actions (CTAs), buttons, key titles (like in the 'Core Tenets' section), and hover effects to guide the user's eye and highlight interactive elements.

### 3. Typography
* **Headings (h1, h2, h3):** I chose **Poppins** for all headings. Its bold and geometric style gives the site a strong, modern, and confident tone that fits a high-tech company.
* **Body Text:** I used **Inter** for all body text. It's a highly readable sans-serif font that works perfectly for descriptions and paragraphs on a dark background.

### 4. Animations
To make the page feel more dynamic and premium, I added subtle on-scroll animations using **Framer Motion**. This includes fade-in and slide-up effects on sections like 'Our Mission' and the 'Capabilities' cards, which engages the user as they scroll.

### 5. Responsiveness
The site is fully responsive, built mobile-first. I used Tailwind's utility classes to ensure the layout adapts from a single-column view on mobile to multi-column grids on tablets and desktops (e.g., the 'Capabilities' cards).
